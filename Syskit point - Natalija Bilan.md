**Introduction**

Whether you want to boost your company security, ensure compliance, easily control user

access or you simply want to automate HR procedures for better efficiency, SysKit Point is a

tool for you.

**Shared Content with external users**

One of the better features this tool provides is shared content with external users. This tool also

provides you the possibility to see what individual external user has access to. So, without

further ado, let me show how you can access content shared with external users.

For the first step, you will need to sign in with your (Microsoft) account to [Syskit](https://syskit-point-e2e-test.azurewebsites.net/)[ ](https://syskit-point-e2e-test.azurewebsites.net/)[Point](https://syskit-point-e2e-test.azurewebsites.net/)[.](https://syskit-point-e2e-test.azurewebsites.net/)[ ](https://syskit-point-e2e-test.azurewebsites.net/)By

clicking to Sign In button, you will be redirected to the Microsoft account sign-in page.

After entering your account address and password you can expect SysKit Point home page.





As you can see, the home page is transparent and user-friendly. It’s also intuitively and easy to

use whether you need to manage Groups, Users, or sites. It also provides you with a nice

dashboard where you can find a summary of all your resources.

Let’s find content shared with one or more external users. To do so, we need to select **Reports**

that will lead us to the **Report Center**.

After opening Report Center, we can see many choices this tool provides us. Just by clicking it

on **Externally Shared Content** we can easily see in the format of the list content shared with

external users.





For further access we have 2 choices, we can click directly on the URL that leads us to

SharePoint, or we can click on the name, and we can see what folders or files are being shared.

To access files just simply click on the URL that will lead us to the wanted content.





**Steps summary**

➢ Open the web portal and log in with your Microsoft account

➢ Select Reports

➢ Select Externally Shared Content

➢ Choose content by clicking on it in column Name or directly by clicking it on URL

**Optional**

If you need to see what user access have to which files, follow these steps:

➢ Instead of selecting Reports, select Users

➢ Select external users

➢ Select the user you want by clicking on his/her name

➢ Click on Sites

➢ In the field Content, you can see all content user has access
