For the purpose of this article, we’ll focus on **Sites With External Sharing**.


## Sites With External Sharing

Above the title **Sites With External Sharing**, you’ll find the number of sites that have external sharing enabled. However, in order to view more details about these sites, you’ll need to select the option itself.

Clicking on **Sites With External Sharing** will open the Sites overview section for you. 

Here you’ll find all of your externally shared sites listed, along with other details such as who the **primary admin** is for a specific site, when the access was **last modified**, who can **access the site**, and how many **external users** have access.
