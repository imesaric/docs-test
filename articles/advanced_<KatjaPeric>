This article explains how to access information on content shared with external users by using SysKit Point. 

# SysKit Point Dashboard & External Collaboration

If you want to locate all of the content you’ve shared with one or more external users, the first step is opening the SysKit web application and selecting the **Dashboard** option.  

Once you’re on the **Dashboard Overview** screen, you’ll see a section titled External Collaboration. Within this section there are several options: 
- External Users
- Sites With External Sharing
- Links Shared With Anyone
- Sites Shared With Anyone

For the purpose of this article, we’ll focus on **Sites With External Sharing**.


## Sites With External Sharing

Above the title **Sites With External Sharing**, you’ll find the number of sites that have external sharing enabled. However, in order to view more details about these sites, you’ll need to select the option itself. 

Clicking on **Sites With External Sharing** will open the Sites overview section for you. 

Here you’ll find all of your externally shared sites listed, along with other details such as who the **primary admin** is for a specific site, when the access was **last modified**, who can **access the site**, and how many **external users** have access. 

Selecting a Site from the list will offer additional options on the right side of the screen. There you can choose between the following actions:

- Add Admins
- Remove Admins
- Change Admins
- Manage Policies
- Change Sharing Settings
- Configure Alerts

Once you’re finished with any changes you might want to make, you can continue exploring your **Sites Dashboard** by changing the filter above from the currently selected **Externally Shared Sites** to whatever option interests you next.
